**customAlchemy** reimpliments vanilla alchemy mechanics to allow batch potion brewing, server side customization and improvement of server performance.

Requires [DataManager](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/DataManager), [GuiFramework](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/GuiFramework), [ContainerFramework](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/ContainerFramework) and optionally [QuickKeyCleaner](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/QuickKeyCleaner), [espParser](https://github.com/JakobCh/tes3mp_scripts/tree/master/espParser)!

Most of the formulas are contained in `formulas.lua` for (relatively) easy access.

You can find the configuration file in `data/custom/__config_CustomAlchemy.json`.
* `importESPs` whether to parse ESP files on startup. Setting this to `true` will significantly increase your server starting times and RAM usage overall. It is recommended to use the `caimportesps` command when necessary. Default `false`.
* `cmdRank` rank required to use the `caimportesps` command. Default `2` (admin).
* `progressSkill` wheter to increase player alchemy skill. Requires [LevelingFramework](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/LevelingFramework). Default `false`.
* `disableQuickKeys` wheter to restrict adding aclhemy apparatuses to quick key slots. Requires [QuickKeyCleaner](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/QuickKeyCleaner). Default `false`.
* `menu` is a list of all GUI ids used by customAlchemy. Edit this if some other scripts happen to use the same ones.
* `fail`
  * `sound` plays when potion brewing is failed.
  * `messageAttempt` is shown when player didn't roll successfully to make any potions.
  * `messageTooMany` is shown when player puts too many ingredients inside the container.
  * `messageUseless` is shown when the resulting potion has no effects.
* `success`
  * `sound` plays when potion(s) are brewed.
  * `message1` is shown when 1 potion is brewed.
  * `message` is shown when multiple potions are brewed.
* `burden` refId prefix of burden spells applied to the players to offset whatever ingredients are stored in the alchemy apparatuses.
* `container`
  * `baseId` container used as a base. By default it is a dead rat. Currently you can't use actual cotnainers and should pick a creature or an NPC.
  * `refId` refId of the custom container used by this script. Edit for script compatibility.
  * `name` how the custom container is called.
  * `type` should be the same type as `baseId`
  * `location` position at which containers are placed in `cell`
* `potionEffectTreshold` the amount of ingredients with the same effect necessary for the potion to have that effect. The default value is 2.
* `maximumIngredientCount` how many different ingredients can be added to a potion. Default is 4.
* `apparatuses` necessary data about all the alchemy apparatuses used. Can be used to make custom alchemy tools.
* `ingredients` necessary data about all the ingredients. By default only contains ingredients from the original game and the expansions, has to be edited to accomodate for mods. Can also be used to make custom ingredients. For information about numeric values consult the table below.
* `effects` necessary data for magical effects. For information about numeric values consult the table below.

Commands:
* `caimportesps` load ingredient and apparatus data from ESPs
